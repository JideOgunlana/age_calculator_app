## The challenge

**To do this challenge, a decent understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**\
The challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to: 

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Typescript
- CSS
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
As a beginner in TypeScript, this challenge has provided me with the opportunity to enhance my understanding of React and its integration with TypeScript.

### Continued development
- Typescript knowledge is at an infant stage and needs to be worked on
- Breaking down possible parts of the app into components
- File structure of the react app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.

`npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

`npm run eject`: If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
